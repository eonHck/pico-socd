# Pico SOCD

This is a simple program to use a Raspberry Pi Pico as a Second Input Priority Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Directions (SOCD) cleaner.

This could likely be built for other RP2040 boards, but this has not been tested.

Additional functionality may be added in the future.

## Pin mapping:

### Input Pins
* GPIO 0 - Up
* GPIO 1 - Down
* GPIO 2 - Left
* GPIO 3 - Right

### Output Pins
